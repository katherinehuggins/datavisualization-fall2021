# Pitch Idea

### Katherine Huggins

I think an interesting data-driven story could be about campaign donations from corporations. For example, [telecommunications companies] (https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/08/telecom-and-telephone-utility-companies-spend-big-infrastructure-deal-clears-hurdle/) have spent loads on lobbying for the infrastructure bill. But to narrow the scope of the article, the piece should focus on the 34 senators up for reelection in 2022. It's a big undertaking BUT all the data is readily available through public campaign finance disclosures. 
The story is timely because it would illuminate who is taking money from whom ahead of a campaign, which corporations want which lawmakers to stay in office (excluding any senators who decline such contributions of course), and expose potential political motivations from both parties.

Possible sources include:
* campaign finance lawyer(s)
* Op-ed writers who have [written on this topic before] (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/op-ed-the-best-way-to-get-corporate-americas-money-out-of-politics.html)
* lawmakers who have a no corporate money policy (It could also be interesting to tease this out into a separate story idea possibly — Cruz and Hawley were among those to promise something along these lines.)

# Story Critique

### https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/lawless-one-in-three-alaska-villages-have-no-local-police/

Clarity — 4.
I felt that the article was very thorough but broad, and possibly could have been broken into two or more stories. Generally, it is clear that the issue is there are many villages in Alaska without police, or barely any. However, when the article started discussing vetting for village police and the fact that people with domestic violence records have been hired, that felt sort of separate to me. It went from talking to no one is working and we can't hire anybody to some people (I'm assuming very few based off the overall hiring numbers) have violent records. In my opinion, that should have been teased out into a second story idea.

Data Visualization Clarity — 3
The main visualization, the map with dots of where there is no police, was effective but I thought it could have been better done. Perhaps adding more color and outlining communities so you get a better picture of where there is no police. For example, I'm assuming a lot of Alaska is just wilderness and none of that is portrayed on the map, making it seem like there's actually more police in Alaska than there is.

Data Accuracy — 5
Yes, I think this data is clear and accurate, because it's mainly looking at communities and asking a yes or no question. It may have changed though, if one-man forces retired or quit.

Quality — 5
This was an extremely comprehensive and well-written piece with strong supporting data

Type & Color
The typogrpahy throughout the article is clear and reads well. While the photos add color, I do wish the visualization had a little more umph to it — making it more comprehensible and eye-catching.
