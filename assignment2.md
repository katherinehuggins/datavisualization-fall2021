## Background Research on Campaign Donations of Senators Up for Reelection in 2022

Since it is more than a year before the 2022 elections, very little has been published about the campaign finance of those running for reelection. I imagine this is in part because 1) people will either forget or it's not close enough for them to care and 2) a lot of donations can come in and/or change in one year. With those constrictions in mind, I still think the data project would be worthwhile, as we'd largely be publishing/getting ahead of other publications AND because the senators still have much financial history due to their longer terms. (It would be less worth it to attempt to do House members for the opposite reason).

*Here is what has previously been published in regards to 2022:*

- https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/08/secret-donors-are-already-pouring-dark-money-into-2022/ (shows that there is data worth covering already there!)
- https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/04/fundraising-records-break-to-kick-off-2022-cycle/

- https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/rand-paul/2021/10/05/charles-booker-rand-paul-campaign-fundraising-updates/6005095001/

I expect similar articles will continue to be published in the coming weeks and months, however, none of these stories are comprehensive. Each focuses on a single lawmaker or handful of lawmakers. Additionally, almost all of these stories lack data visualization — except for the one graphic contrasting ALL-TIME highest donations, so there is a lot that hasn't been explored yet. I also think looking at state data, in addition to industry data, could be fascinating — see how much financing for a senator is coming from out of state.
