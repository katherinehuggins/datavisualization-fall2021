# Is Inflation Affecting the Price of Your Milk?

A CNN segment went viral in November after it showed a Texas family complaining about the alleged rising costs of milk due to inflation. That family in question disproportionately felt the affect of the rising cost because they apparently purchase 12 gallons of milk per week.
That amount was widely mocked as absurd — even for a family of 11 — but the story buried the lede: milk is hardly more expensive that it normally is.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has been tracking the average price of various household items since late 2001, the price for a gallon of fresh, whole milk was on a national average, 66 cents more expensive in October than that same item was exactly five years ago, in October 2016. Sixty-six extra cents per gallon? That's a mere $7.92 more per week for a family of 11 buying 12 gallons — hardly worth complaining about on national television, especially when you look at the rising and falling pattern pictured below.

Milk generally IS more expensive in the fall, and the $3.66 per gallon price point last month is not unheard of; the average cost was more expensive than that in the falls of 2007, 2008, and 2014, as well as a few various points between.

## Milk Costs Have Ticked Upward in the Past 12 Months, But Are Nothing Out of the Ordinary
